Binary Search Trees

This repo shows the implementation of Binary Search Trees.

The code has been conducted using C++, but the concepts are the same and can be shown 
in many other languages.

Requirements:
    The repo has a Makefile attached with it. So it is very easy and convenient 
    to run the project

    You must have make installed and g++ as well. 

    I am using c++11 as the standard, so make sure you have that installed.
